The leukemia dataset is described in the recent paper of Golub el al. [17] and available
at http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/MPR. This dataset comes from a study of gene ex-
pression in two types of acute leukemias: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression levels were measured using Aymetrix high-
density oligonucleotide arrays containing p = 6; 817 human genes. The data comprise 47
cases of ALL (38 B-cell ALL and 9 T-cell ALL) and 25 cases of AML.
The following pre-processing steps were applied (personal communication, Pablo Tamayo):
(i) thresholding: floor of 100 and ceiling of 16,000; (ii) ltering: exclusion of genes with
max = min  5 and (maxâˆ’min)  500, where max and min refer respectively to the maxi-
mum and minimum expression levels of a particular gene across mRNA samples; (iii) base
10 logarithmic transformation.
The data are then summarized by a 723571 matrix X = (xij), where xij denotes the base
10 logarithm of the expression level for gene j in mRNA sample i. Figure 2 displays images
of the 72  72 correlation matrix between gene expression proles for the 72 tumors.

In this study, the data are already divided into a learning set of 38 mRNA samples and a test
set of 34 mRNA samples. The observations in the two sets came from dierent labs and were
collected at dierent times. The test set is actually more heterogeneous than the learning set
as it comprises a broader range of samples, including samples from peripheral blood as well
as bone marrow, from childhood AML patients, and from laboratories that used dierent
sample preparation protocols. In Section 6 we address the impact of this heterogeneity on
the performance of the predictors.
